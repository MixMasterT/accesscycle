# TEST PROJECT

## Showing You Bicycle Rental Availability

You may not know about where in the world bike rental is available as a
means of transportation. Rental bikes have become a popular option for
transit systems in cities around the world. For example, in Taiwan several
cities offer bike rental with metro passes, allowing users to ride to a
destination, and then check the bike back in to a locked bike station.

This Website shows where bike rental is available, and gives information
about the availability of bikes and bike locking stations. Data for this
frontend project is draws from the [CityBikes API](http://api.citybik.es/v2/)
